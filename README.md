# CHIRP Project

This is my fork of [the official git repository](https://github.com/kk7ds/chirp) for the
__[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com)__ project.

My fork includes the following modification over the official version:
* **Support for the `AIR` channel mode (AM with 8.33kHz bandwidth)** (see [my Quansheng UV-K5 CHIRP driver](https://github.com/ntoivola/uvk5-chirp-driver-nunu/tree/main))

When submitting PRs, please squash commits into logical units in a fashion
similar to what is currently expected by the project on the mailing list.

For Python3 driver testing status, see [this file](tests/Python3_Driver_Testing.md).
